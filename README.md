The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the role of the magnetic and electric force on the filtration performance of wet granular beds. At first, the effect of wetting is considered by locating micro water film around the square channel for particle deposition in three different Reynolds numbers (Re=1, Re=5, Re=10). Typically, 1000 particles of different sizes (100ùëõm‚àí10ùúám ) were injected into the microchannel when air and water formed completely on the surface of the block. Drag force, Brownian force, Saffman`s lift force and gravity force affect the particles. After that, Dielectrophoretic and Magnetophoretic forces were included in the domain for investigating the role of these forces in collecting aerosol particles. A 2-D microchannel and a micro single square fiber, which is located in the microchannel and its blockage ratio is 0.25, are considered in this simulation. Comsol software is used for simulating. By adding a film of water around the block, the efficiency of capturing particles is increased, especially in low Reynolds numbers. For the effect of the electrostatic and electromagnetic field, the variation for particle deposition is 0 to 20 %.
